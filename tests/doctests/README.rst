Documentation and doctests
--------------------------

This directory contains several files with examples of the use of the :code:`checkit` module. Those having the string "doctest" in their names can serve as doctests. These files' main purpose is documentation, but whenever they can also serve a testing purpose, they do. The use of doctests also helps us decrease the risk that the examples do not work.
