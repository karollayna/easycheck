Documentation and doctests
--------------------------

This directory contains several files with examples of the use of checkit. Those having the .txt extension can serve as doctests, while those having the .rst extention cannot, since they include examples that cannot be run. These files' main purpose is documentation, but whenever they can also serve a testing purpose, they do.
